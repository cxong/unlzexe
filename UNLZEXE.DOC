  UNLZEXE converts the executable file which is compressed by Fabrice
Bellard's LZEXE (ver.0.90,0.91) to decompressed executable one.

  In the present version, a bug in the routine which expands the
relocation table compressed by LZEXE ver. 0.90 was fixed.
                                          ^^^^^

USAGE:

  There are three modes of operation.

 1. The most convenient and easy way to use UNLZEXE is, 

        A>UNLZEXE filename[.EXE]

where filename is the name of the EXE file to be decompressed. The extension
".EXE" is implied by default. UNLZEXE uses a temporally file "$TMPFIL$.EXE",
and makes a "new" decompressed "filename.exe". The old compressed file is
renamed to "filename.OLZ".

 2. If you want a DIFFERENT file name for the decompressed one, type as 
   follows,

        A>UNLZEXE  packedfile[.EXE]]  unpackedfile[.EXE] 

where packedfile  is the name of the compressed file by LZEXE and
unpackedfile is the name of the decompressed file. The extensions ".EXE"
are NOT required (default). The "packedfile.EXE" remains, and the 
"unpackedfile.EXE" is created.


 3. If the SAME NAME for the "packedfile[.EXE]" and the "unpackedfile[.EXE]
  is used,

        A>UNLZEXE samename[.EXE]  samename[.EXE]

UNLZEXE writes out decommpressed "$TMPFIL$.EXE", then the old "samename.exe"
is DELETED, and finally "$TMPFIL$.EXE is renamed to "samename.exe".


Notice: The UNpacked file is executable and its load module is the same
======  as the original one, but the header and the relocation table of
        the UNpacked executable file may be different from those of the
        original executable file.
          Please use UNLZEXE to study the function of LZEXE itself or
        when you need to decompress the executable file that is originally
        provided as decompressed form by LZEXE.

        UNLZEXE is distributed as PUBLIC DOMAIN.
